## 🔎 About Me

I’m from the UK 🇬🇧, currently based in Kent 🏡. I’m passionate about **artificial intelligence 🤖, esports 🎮, and building powerful applications 💻**. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably catch me in the gym 🏋️, competing in Rocket League tournaments 🚀, or tinkering with custom PC builds. I love learning and experimenting with new tech, from **machine learning models** to **full-stack projects**, and I’m always looking for ways to push myself further 🌟.
